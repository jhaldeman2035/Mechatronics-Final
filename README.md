# Mechatronics-Final
Final Project for MEMS 1049 - Automatic RFID-based Dog Door

This code (main.c) was written in Atmel Studio 7 for the ATMega328P microcontroller.
The project was done in a group of three, however the code was primarily my responsibility,
with my groupmates working primarily on the physical and electrical parts of the project.

To run, create a new project in Atmel Studio for the ATMega328P and replace the default main.c with this one.
May require a simulator if hardware is not available.
